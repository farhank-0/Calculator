fundamental techniques pertaining to front end web development in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
## HTML file

## CSS file
- Learned how to more efficiently style a page using a variety of techniques on the same stylesheet but applied to different elements
- Learned how to apply a gradient background 
- Applied CSS grid and flexbox to varying calculator elements (where CSS grid was applied to the buttons and flexbox was applied to the display output and placement on body)
## Javascript file
- Learned how to declare a class and create methods within a class
- Learned how to query select from data selectors rather than class or ID
- Learned how to convert from number to string to display text on calculator output without inaccuracies in splitting large numbers with commas or multiple decimal places
- Applied knowledge of object type to convert from string to number to perform simple calculations within operate function
- Applied knowledge of loops and built in forEach method to add an event listener to all buttons for a click event
